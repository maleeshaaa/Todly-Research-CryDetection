# Toddler Cry Detection and Monitoring System

## Overview
This research addresses the challenge of accurately interpreting toddler cry patterns in diverse environments, including:
- **Noisy surroundings**
- **Situations where the child is distant from the microphone**

The goal is to develop an **advanced toddler monitoring system** that can analyze cry patterns and provide caregivers with actionable insights.

## Key Features
- **High-fidelity microphones** for precise sound capture
- **Sophisticated signal processing** for noise reduction and clarity
- **Advanced machine learning algorithms** for cry classification
- **Real-time caregiver interaction** via a Flutter-based mobile application
- **Recommendation engine** for personalized caregiver guidance

## Methodology
The system follows a structured process:
1. **Data Acquisition** – Collect cry samples in various environments
2. **Preprocessing** – Normalize signals, trim silence, and reduce noise
3. **Feature Extraction** – Use Librosa to extract **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**
4. **Classification** – Train Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify cry types
5. **Integration** – Connect the model with the mobile app and recommendation engine
6. **Testing & Evaluation** – Assess accuracy, robustness, and usability

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data processing and model training
- **Librosa** for audio analysis and MFCC extraction
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for classification
- **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile app development

## Impact
The proposed solution aims to:
- Empower caregivers with personalized recommendations based on detected cry types
- Enhance understanding of child needs
- Reduce caregiver stress
- Improve child well-being through early detection of potential health issues

This approach can be applied in **personalized childcare solutions** and **early health issue detection**, providing a comprehensive upgrade to existing toddler monitoring systems.
